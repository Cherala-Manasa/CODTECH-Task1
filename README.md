## Overview of the Project

### Project: Simple Calculator
![task1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abe46870-669b-4b7a-a875-7c43096cc744)

### Objective
This project is a Simple Calculator implemented in Java that provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with advanced operations like modulus, exponentiation, and square root. The calculator features a user-friendly console interface and supports input validation, memory storage for previous calculations, and a detailed history of past calculations.

### Key Activities
-- **Design and Development:** Designed a console-based Java application to handle basic and advanced arithmetic operations.
                               Implemented a menu-driven system to allow users to choose from different mathematical operations.
-- **User Interaction and Input Validation:** Handled user input using the Scanner class and provided input validation for division by zero, square root of negative numbers, and invalid operation choices.
-- **Memory and History Features:** Stored the result of each calculation for future reference using memory storage.
                                    Implemented a feature to view and display a history of all previous calculations during the session.
-- **Error Handling:** Managed exceptions such as division by zero and invalid user inputs to prevent crashes and provide clear error messages.

### Technologies Used
-- **Java:** The core programming language used for developing the application.
-- **Java I/O:** Utilized Scanner class for capturing user input and interacting through the console.
-- **Java Collections:** Employed ArrayList to store calculation history and display it upon user request.
-- **Math Library:** Used built-in Java Math functions like Math.pow() for exponentiation and Math.sqrt() for square roots.

### Key Insights
-- **nput Validation is Crucial:** Handling edge cases like division by zero and negative inputs for square roots ensures the application runs smoothly without errors.
-- **User Experience:** A simple menu-driven interface and error messages improve user interaction, making the application more user-friendly.
-- **Code Modularity:** Structuring the code with separate methods for each operation (addition, subtraction, etc.) makes the program more maintainable and extendable.
-- **Expandable Design:** The use of modular functions and clear operation symbols lays the foundation for adding more features like trigonometric functions or memory recall in future versions.
